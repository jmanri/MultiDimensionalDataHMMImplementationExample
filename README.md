# MultiDimensionalDataHMMImplementationExample
This example contains MATLAB LiveScript code for testing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using multi-dimensional trajectory data.
The dataset consists of synthetically generated 2D and 3D square trajectories, to which controlled noise is added.
The workflow includes trajectory normalization, dimensionality  reduction, symbolic encoding via a codebook, HMM training, and  trajectory decoding.
The main goal of this project is to explore symbolic modeling of continuous trajectories and temporal pattern learning using HMMs.
